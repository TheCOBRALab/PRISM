#### Supported OS: 
Linux 
macOS 

### Installation:  
Requirements: A compiler that supports C++11 standard (tested with g++ version 4.7.2 or higher)  and CMake version 3.1 or greater.    

[CMake](https://cmake.org/install/) version 3.1 or greater must be installed in a way that HFold can find it.    
To test if your Mac or Linux system already has CMake, you can type into a terminal:      
```
cmake --version
```
If it does not print a cmake version greater than or equal to 3.1, you will have to install CMake depending on your operating system.

#### Mac:    
Easiest way is to install homebrew and use that to install CMake.    
To do so, run the following from a terminal to install homebrew:      
```  
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"   
```    
When that finishes, run the following from a terminal to install CMake.     
```   
brew install cmake   
``` 
#### Linux:    
Run from a terminal     
```
wget http://www.cmake.org/files/v3.8/cmake-3.8.2.tar.gz
tar xzf cmake-3.8.2.tar.gz
cd cmake-3.8.2
./configure
make
make install
```

#### Steps for installation   
1. [Download the repository](https://github.com/HosnaJabbari/HFold.git) and extract the files onto your system.
2. From a command line in the root directory (where this README.md is) run
```
cmake -H. -Bbuild
cmake --build build
```   
If you need to specify a specific compiler, such as g++, you can instead run something like   
```
cmake -H. -Bbuild -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++
cmake --build build
```   
This can be useful if you are getting errors about your compiler not having C++17 features.

Help
========================================

```
Usage: PRISM[options] [input sequence]
```

Read input file from cmdline; predict minimum free energy, ensemble energy, optimum structure, and BPP structure using the RNA folding algorithm.


```
  -h, --help             Print help and exit
  -V, --version          Print version and exit
  -r, --input-structure  Give a restricted structure as an input structure
  -i, --input-file       Give a path to an input file containing the sequence (and input structure if known)
  -o, --output-file      Give a path to an output file which will the sequence, and its structure and energy
  -n, --opt              Specify the number of suboptimal structures to output (default is 1)
  -p  --pk-free          Specify whether you only want the pseudoknot-free structure to be calculated
  -k  --pk-only          Only add base pairs which cross the constraint structure. The constraint structure is returned if there are no energetically favorable crossing base pairs
  -d  --dangles          Specify the dangle model to be used (base is 2)
  -P, --paramFile        Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of using the default parameter set.\n
  -s, --samples          Give the number of samples foe the stochastic backtracking (default 1000)
      --noConv           Do not convert DNA into RNA. This will use the Matthews 2004 parameters for DNA
      --noPS             Don't create a Postscript drawing of the base pair probabilities
  
```


#### How to use:

    Remarks:
        make sure the <arguments> are enclosed in "", for example -r "..(...).." instead of -r ..(...)..
        input file for -i must be .txt
        if -i is provided with just a file name without a path, it is assuming the file is in the diretory where the executable is called
        if -o is provided with just a file name without a path, the output file will be generated in the diretory where the executable is called
        if -o is provided with just a file name without a path, and if -i is provided, then the output file will be generated in the directory where the input file is located
        if suboptimal structures are specified, repeated structures are skipped. That is, if different input structures come to the same conclusion, only those that are different are shown
        If no input structure is given, or suboptimal structures are greater than the number given, PRISM generates hotspots to be used as input structures -- where hotspots are energetically favorable stems
        The default parameter file is DP09. This can be changed via -P and specifying the parameter file you would like
        A Postscript file will be generated automatically showing the base pairing probabilities. This can be turned off with --noPS
    
    Sequence requirements:
        containing only characters GCAU

    Structure requirements:
        -pseudoknot free
        -containing only characters .x()
        Remarks:
            Restricted structure symbols:
                () restricted base pair
                . no restriction
                x restricted to unpaired


    Input file requirements:
            Line1: FASTA name (optional)
            Line2: Sequence
            Line3: Structure
        sample:
            >Sequence1 (optional)
            GCAACGAUGACAUACAUCGCUAGUCGACGC
            (............................)

#### Output Information
    Output text format:
        Line1: Sequence
        Line2: MFE structure (MFE energy)
        Line3: BPP structure (Ensemble Energy)
        Line4: MEA structure (MEA)
        Line5: Centroid structure (distance)
        Line6: Shape (Frequency of shape)
        Line7: Frequency of MFE in ensemble (Frequency); ensemble diversity (diversity)

    Remarks:
        The BPP structure gives an output structure based on the probabilitiy of that base pair
        occuring across the sampled structures. For pseudoknot-free base pairs, 
        {} indicates .334<p<=.667 and () indicate p>.667.
        For pseudoknotted base pairs /\ indicates .334<p<=.667 and [] indicate p>.667.

        Dot plot Postscript files give the output in graphical form. Input constraints
        are in black and other probabilities are in red. The MFE structure is in the
        bottom left while the probability structure is in the top right.
